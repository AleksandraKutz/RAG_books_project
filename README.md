# RAG_books_project

This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight semantic search engine using sentence-transformers and FAISS for RAG-style querying over a small collection of public domain books focused on self-improvement and learning. The system combines vector embeddings, semantic chunking, cross-encoder reranking, and Claude AI to deliver contextual answers with source citations through a vintage library-styled web interface built with Flask.
