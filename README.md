# RAG_books_project

Classic Books RAG System

This project implements an advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for interactive work with classic books. The system allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive answers based on book content, while maintaining context and source references.

Key Features:
- Semantic search in book texts using advanced embedding models
- Intelligent answer generation leveraging Claude API
- Multilingual support - the system understands and responds in the user's language
- Precise source display with semantic similarity information

Technologies:
- Flask as the web framework
- Sentence Transformers for embedding generation
- FAISS for efficient semantic search
- Claude API for answer generation
- Translation system for multi-language support

The project was developed using modern AI tools (Claude, Cursor) to support the development process, enabling the implementation of advanced features and system performance optimization.
